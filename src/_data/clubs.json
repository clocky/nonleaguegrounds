    "description": "Aldershot Town were formed in 1992 as a phoenix club from the ashes of Aldershot FC. They spent the first decade of their existence in the Isthmian League, gaining promotion to the Football Conference in 2002. In 2008, they won the Conference Premier title and returned to the Football League after a 16-year absence. However, they were relegated back to the Conference Premier in 2013, and after a period of administration and uncertainty, they were able to pay off all their debts and remain in the Conference Premier. The 2014-15 season saw them remain in the Conference Premier and the 2015-16 season saw them reach the play-offs, but they were unable to achieve promotion. In 2017-18, they again reached the play-offs, but were again unsuccessful. They were relegated from the National League at the end of the 2018-19 season and they started the 2019-20 season in the National League South.",

The club has played in the Football League since 1988 and achieved promotion to the third tier in 1994, although they have experienced relegation several times.

After relegation to the National League in 2018, the Bees secured a place in the play-offs in the 2019/20 season, although they were eventually defeated by Notts County.",

The most widely-held view is that the club was founded in 1866, but there is no contemporary evidence to support this claim. In 1867, Chesterfield Football Club officially formed and played their first match in February 1868. After the club folded in 1881, another club was created in 1884 under the name of Chesterfield Town FC. This name was later changed to Chesterfield FC in 1915, and the current club dates from April 1919, when it was formed as the Chesterfield Municipal FC.",

Notable successes in the following decades include winning the Hampshire League, Hampshire Intermediate Cup and Wessex League, as well as promotion to the Isthmian League. In the past decade, the club has twice flirted with promotion to the Conference Premier, and have had two impressive FA Cup runs, most recently against Championship side Brentford in the Third Round.

    "description": "Gateshead AFC was formed in 1930 when neighbours South Shields moved to Gateshead due to financial difficulties. The newly formed 'Tynesiders' almost immediately achieved promotion to the second division, but were denied by Lincoln City's superior goal average. Despite an average placing of ninth in 21 Third Division North campaigns, Gateshead were voted out of the League in 1960 and were forced to join the Northern Counties League and then the Northern Premier League. They became founder members of the Northern Premier League, but their stay in the new competition lasted only two years. Gateshead then became a phoenix club, eventually becoming a full-time professional club in 2010 and won back-to-back promotions to reach the Conference Premier. They reached the FA Cup Third Round in 2013 and played in the Conference Premier until 2018. That year, they were taken over by a fan-led consortium and were demoted to the National League North. In 2021, the Heed defied 20/1 odds to become Vanarama National League North champions and return to the National League.",

    "description": "Notts County Football Club, officially formed in 1864, is widely recognised as the world's oldest Football League club. The club initially played matches of its own devising at Park Hollow, before moving to various locations, including Castle Cricket Ground, Nottingham Forest's Town Ground and City Ground. The main home from 1883 onwards was Trent Bridge, until the permanent switch to Meadow Lane was completed in 1910. In 1888, Notts County became one of 12 founder members of the Football League, and Ernest Greenhalgh was the club's first international player.",

They lost their top-flight status in 1923 and spent most of the intervening years in lower divisions, including three championship winning campaigns in 1952/53, 1973/74 and 1990/91. In 1992-93, they were founding members of the Premier League and enjoyed success in both cup competitions (FA and League Cup). Recently, the club had to go into administration in 2003, but was saved by three American-based businessmen in November of the same year.",

Southend United were formed in 1906 and gained election to the professional Southern League Second Division. After World War I, the club moved to The Kursaal and were elected to the Football League in 1920. During the 1920s, Bob Jack's side won two Southern League Division Two titles and they entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1907. In 1933, Ted Birnie became manager and turned the club into one that challenged for promotion. During World War II, the team had to relocate to Chelmsford City's New Writtle Street ground. After the war, David Jack took over as manager and the team moved to the Southend Stadium in Grainger Road. They narrowly missed the dreaded re-election vote in 1948/49, but the following season saw the Shrimpers challenging for promotion.",

    "description": "Wealdstone Football Club was formed at the start of the 1899/1900 season, when it competed in the Willesden & District League. It won its first Championship of the same league in 1904/05, but has since been proven to have links to a series of preceding clubs as the result of mergers and demergers. In 1929/30 the club won the Middlesex Senior Challenge Cup and Middlesex Senior Charity Cup for the first time, and they have since won each trophy eleven times. In 1946, Wealdstone took part in the first televised football match, and in 1949 they experienced their first FA Cup tie against a Football League side. In 1971, the club turned professional and joined the Southern League, eventually making their way back to the Football Conference. In 2008, they moved to their own ground at Grosvenor Vale and in 2014 they became Ryman Premier League champions, winning promotion to the Vanarama National League South. In 2019/20 they were promoted to the National League and in 2021/22 they finished in 16th place, their highest league position for 35 years.",

    "description": "Woking Football Club was formed in 1887. They joined the Isthmian League in 1911 and achieved success in the FA Amateur Cup in 1957. The club struggled in the 1980s and faced financial trouble, but was kept afloat by a friendly match against Bolton Wanderers. The 1990s saw the club achieve great success, with three FA Trophy wins and five successive top five finishes in the Conference. The club also had several successful runs in the FA Cup, reaching the Third Round in 1996/97. In 2002, the club was saved from administration when successful businessman and long-time fan Chris Ingram became Chairman. The club's fortunes declined and they were relegated to the Blue Square South in 2009. After a successful spell in the BSS, the club were promoted back to the Conference Premier in 2012. The following season saw the Cards finish in a commendable 7th spot, missing a play-off place by only three points. The 2016-17 season saw the club struggle and they were only able to avert relegation thanks to improved form in the second half of the season. Alan Dowson was appointed manager in 2018 and the club achieved promotion back to the National League via the play-offs.",

In 2004 the club dropped down to the Conference, but earned promotion back to the Football League in 2012. They have suffered relegation twice since then, and will compete in regional non-league football in 2017/18 for the first time since 1929. City have earned the title of 'giantkillers' over the years and have reached the quarter finals and semi-finals of the FA Cup, as well as the quarter finals of the Football League Cup. They have also won the FA Trophy twice, in 2011/12 and 2016/17.",

    "description": "Boston United Football Club was established in 1933 but football had been played in the town since the late 1800s. They achieved major success under the management of Ray Middleton in the 1950s, winning the Midland League and reaching the second round of the FA Cup. They joined the Southern League in 1958 and the Northern Premier League in 1968, winning the championship four times and the League Cup twice. In 1977, the ground was deemed not suitable for the Football League and the directors vowed to make it suitable. They achieved this in 1979 and joined the Alliance Premier League (now the National League) as founder-members. They won the Conference title in 2002 and were promoted to the Football League, but were relegated back to the Conference seven years later and were demoted to the Northern Premier League. In 2010, they won promotion back to the Conference via the play-offs and reached the play-offs again in 2015-16 and 2018-19, but lost both times. They moved to their new Community Stadium at The Quadrant in 2020, but were relegated back to the National League North after losing the promotion final to York City in May 2021.",

After a few seasons at this level, the club won the Unibond Division One North title in 2008 and gained promotion to the Conference North. After relegation in 2015, the club regained promotion at the end of the 2017-18 season and reached the play-offs for the following two seasons, but failed to gain promotion.

Known as The Magpies, they have played in six different leagues during their 135-year existence. They achieved their highest finish in the English football pyramid in 1989 when they placed 17th in the Football Conference. With the appointment of Gary Flitcroft as manager in 2010, the Club began a remarkable revival, culminating in a return to the fifth tier of English football in 2019. Their record FA Cup run came in the 2020/21 season when they reached the Fourth Round. The Club's best season in the FA Trophy was 1995-96 when they reached the semi-finals.",

They turned professional in 1908 and joined the North Eastern League, winning it in 1913. They reached the last sixteen of the FA Cup in 1910/11, but the First World War had a big impact on the club, resulting in money problems. The club won the Third Division North Cup in 1934 and installed floodlights in 1960. They made history in 1955 by playing the first ever FA Cup match under floodlights. They won promotion to the Second Division in 1924-25, but were relegated back to the Third Division North. Quakers reached the League Two play offs in 2008 and the FA Trophy final in 2011, winning the latter. They moved to a new stadium in 2003, but faced financial problems and were relegated out of the Football League in 2009-10. The club was taken over by a supporters group in 2004, and after two promotions in three years, they won the Evostik League title in 2015 and moved back to their home town in 2016. They reached the first round proper of the FA Cup in 2019, but lost in the replay. The fans have raised over £1 million for the club since 2012.",

The club's first season of Conference National football resulted in relegation to the Conference North. After a successful first season, Farsley went on to reach two cup finals, the League Cup and the Doodson Sports League Cup, whilst securing a top five spot in the NCEL Premier Division. They went on to win the West Riding County FA Cup twice in 2016/17 and 2017/18, and were promoted to the EVO-STIK Premier Division in 2017/18 where they achieved a fifth place finish. This was followed by promotion to the National League North in 2018/19 and in 2021 the club survived relegation down to the Northern Premier League on the final day of the season.",

They were the first British club to play with a sponsor's name printed on their shirts, in 1976, and the first to have their initials on their ground's floodlights. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup in 1989, and the third round in 1992, but were relegated from the top flight of non-league football in 2001. After a period of turmoil, they became Conference North Champions in 2008 and won the Evo-Stik Southern League Division One Central Championship in 2015. The club achieved a creditable 8th-place finish in the Vanarama National League North in 2021-22.",

After a series of managerial changes and off-field instability, the team was relegated in 2016, but under the new management of John Eustace and Russ Penn, they have been performing well, finishing in the playoffs in two consecutive seasons and making a memorable FA Cup run in 2021.",

    "description": "Cheshunt FC is the oldest amateur team in Hertfordshire, having been formed in 1880. They disbanded in 1931, only to reform after the Second World War ended. They have achieved success over the years, including winning the Athenian league and Cup double, reaching the FA Cup 4th qualifying round four times and the FA Vase last eight once. In 2018, Craig Edwards was appointed manager and oversaw two successive promotions, culminating in promotion to the Isthmian Premier League. During the 19/20 and 20/21 seasons they were limited by Covid restrictions, but made a flying start to life in the Isthmian Premiership. They also had a fantastic FA Trophy run before being knocked out by Stockport County 1-0 in the 5th round. The club continues to grow with Walking Football, Inclusive teams, A Women's Team and an ever expanding Youth section all seeing success over the season.",

In 2011-2012, they reached their fourth play-off final in six seasons but were again denied promotion. In 2016-2017 they were crowned champions of the Southern Premier Division and were promoted to the National League South. They consolidated their position in this division over the next few seasons, finishing thirteenth and fourteenth respectively in their first two seasons. They reached the Fourth Qualifying Round of the FA Cup in 2019/2020 and finished seventh in 2020/2021, earning a play-off spot.

Despite being evicted from their home stadium at Champion Hill in March 2018, they beat Hendon 4-3 on penalties in front of a record attendance at the KNK Stadium, the home of rivals Tooting & Mitcham Utd. The club have also won a hat trick of awards from the League's AGM for their excellent disciplinary record. In recent years, their Reserve and Youth teams have enjoyed considerable success and three youngsters have been signed by professional clubs for transfer fees.",

    "description": "Tonbridge Football Club were formed in October 1947 and were elected to the Southern League for the 1948-49 season. The club took out a lease on the Angel Ground and became known as 'The Angels'. Despite struggling in the early years, Tonbridge eventually won the Kent Senior Shield in 1951/52 and went on to win it a further four times. The club also reached two Southern League Cup finals and two Kent Senior Cup finals. Tonbridge were relegated from the Premier Division in 1961/62 but were promoted two seasons later. In 1972/73 they won promotion to the Premier Division again and reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup four times. The club suffered financial troubles and went into voluntary liquidation in 1976. Tonbridge Angels FC was then formed and allowed to complete the fixture list on the understanding that relegation would result at the end of the 1975/76 season, wherever the club finished. After a battle with their landlords, a new ground at Longmead was offered to the club, where they have been based ever since. Tonbridge returned to the Southern League in 1993/94 after winning the Kent League title and won promotion back to the Ryman Isthmian League Premier Division in 2006 after a dramatic play-off final victory over Dover Athletic.",

    "description": "Wrexham AFC, the oldest football club in Wales and the third oldest professional club in the world, celebrated the anniversary of their first match on October 22, 2022 - 158 years on from that first game in 1864. Since then, the club has made its mark in Welsh football, notably by winning the inaugural Welsh Cup, becoming the oldest international football stadium in the world, and producing a number of giant-killing feats in the FA Cup and European competitions. Wrexham has also gone through many changes since then, developing a strong industrial and retail sector, and being spared relegation thanks to the restructuring of the Football League in 1991. The club was famously saved from the brink of extinction by its loyal supporters and has gone on to record some of its greatest successes, including an FA Trophy win in 2013. As Wrexham AFC celebrates its 158th anniversary, the club and the town remain as intrinsically linked as ever, driven by a shared history, passion and innovation.",

In 1970/71 they were Champions of the Athenian League, and were elected to the Isthmian League in 1973/74. They achieved two cup successes during this time: The Essex Thames-Side Challenge Trophy in 1979/80 and the Hornchurch Charity Cup in 1982/83. In 1989/90 they gained promotion back to Division One with a tremendous end of season run-in. They reached the Third Qualifying Round of the FA Cup in 2002/03 and won the Essex Thames-Side Challenge Trophy for a second time in 2006/07. In 2008/09 they created a club record of 11 straight away league wins and Rod Stringer was judged as Manager of the Season for the Division. They won the Ryman League Division One North Championship and reached the play-off semi-final in 2009/10. In 2018/19 they finished 2nd and lost out in the Play-Off Semi Final against Heybridge Swifts, 2-0.",

    "description": "Bognor F.C. were founded in 1883 and joined the West Sussex Football League in 1896, winning the championship for five successive years in the early 1920s. They joined the Sussex County League in 1927 and won the Division One championship in 1948-49, becoming Bognor Regis Town F.C. at the same time. They were promoted to Division One South of the Southern League in 1972-73, reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. In 1981 they transferred to Division One of the Isthmian League, and were promoted at the end of the 1981-82 season after finishing second. They reached the first round of the FA Cup again in 1984-85 and 1985-86, beating Football League opposition on both occasions. They were relegated back to Division One of the Isthmian League in 1992, but returned to the Premier Division in 2003. They were relegated again in 2009 but won promotion back to the Premier Division in 2012 after a second-place finish and victory in the play-offs. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy in 2016 and won promotion to the National League South in 2017, although they were relegated back to the Isthmian League at the end of that season.",

The club enjoyed a meteoric rise up the football pyramid, culminating in promotion to the Conference League in 2003 after winning the Ryman Premier League title. They reached the 3rd Round Proper of the FA Cup in 2004, and won the FA Trophy in 2000. After dropping back down to the Ryman League Division 1 North in 2006, they were promoted back to the Ryman Premier League via the playoffs in 2008. They won the Essex Senior Cup for the first time in a decade in 2012, and earned promotion back to the Isthmian League Premier Division via the playoffs in 2021. During the 2020/21 season they reached the 2nd Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time.",

In 1973 they were elected as founders of the Isthmian League Division 2, and were promoted to the Isthmian Premier Division in 1976-77. After a period of financial difficulty, the club was purchased by Paul Dipre in 2008 and went on to win the Isthmian League Division One South title in 2002-03. They then competed in the Conference South until they were relegated in 2005-06. In 2015 they installed a 3G pitch, and Colston Avenue has become a busy sports and community hub.",

    "description": "The Corinthian-Casuals Football Club was formed in 1939 following the merger of two great amateur sides, the Corinthians (founded in 1882) and the Casuals (formed in 1883). They toured France in 1940 before the league was suspended for World War II. After the war, they rejoined the Isthmian League and achieved some success, reaching the FA Amateur Cup Final in 1956 and the 1st Round of the FA Cup in 1965/66. In 1973, they were relegated to Division 2 due to a change in ground-sharing rules. The club regained their place in the Isthmian League in 1996, and made it to Division 1 South in 2001. They were relegated again in 2005 but reprieved due to other clubs leaving or merging. In 2006, Brian Adamson was appointed as new manager and fortunes began to improve. The team had mixed results until 2008 when they celebrated 125 years of football with a commemorative match at Wembley Stadium. In 2010 they won the Surrey Senior Cup for the first time in 57 years. In 2015 they returned to Brazil to take on SC Corinthians Paulista's First XI, and in 2019 they won the Egri Erbstein Tournament in Hungary.",

They won the East Sussex League Championship in 1907/08 and were amongst the foremost local sides regularly winning trophies until World War One. When the league resumed in 1919, the club was invited to become a founder member of the Sussex League in 1920. Over the years the club changed its name to Hastings and St. Leonards Football Club, and then to Hastings Town. In 1948 Hastings United F.C. was founded and gained admission to the Southern League, leaving Hastings Town to compete in local leagues until they joined the Corinthian League. The club changed its name to Hastings United in 1999 and gained promotion to the Ryman Isthmian League Premier Division in 2007/08, where they struggled and were relegated. The club had success in cup competitions, reaching the third round of the FA Cup in 2011/12 and the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2012/13. Since then, there have been several managerial changes, and the club is now under the management of Chris Agutter.",

    "description": "Herne Bay FC had their most successful season in their 125th year, winning the Kent League Championship, becoming only the second Kent League club to reach the FA Vase semi-final stage, and winning the Kent Senior Trophy and Kent League Division 1 Cup. They have had successful seasons in the past, such as their unique treble in the 1996/97 season, but have also had disappointing seasons, such as the 2001/02 season where they finished 7th in the league. In the 2008/09 season, they had high hopes for a successful season, but a run of five defeats in six matches in October meant that these hopes were dashed. In the 2011/12 season, they swept all before them and captured the Kent League Premier Division title and promotion to the Ryman League. The 2013/14 season saw a new start for the Bay, resulting in the highest ever finish and points total in the 2014/15 campaign. For the upcoming 2019/20 season, a consortium led by the new chairman, Stuart Fitchie, has taken over the running of the club.",

A fire destroyed the clubhouse in 1989 and in 2005 the club reformed as AFC Hornchurch, winning the Essex Senior League in their first season back. They were promoted to the Ryman Premier Division in 2011 and returned to the Conference South in 2014, but were relegated in 2018.

The nineties were not great for the club, with relegation in 1991 and 1994. In 2010, Lewes FC was transferred out of private ownership into a mass-ownership Community Benefit Society called Lewes Community Football Club. The men's team have been promoted to the Isthmian Premier League and the women's team have reached the FA Women's Premier League (South). In 2015, a 3G all-weather facility was opened adjacent to The Dripping Pan, and in 2017, EqualityFC was launched which saw Lewes FC become the first (and currently only) club side in the world to have equal playing budgets for women and men.",

    "description": "Margate Football Club was founded in 1896 and originally called Margate Town. The club has played in a number of amateur leagues before joining the Kent League in 1923. After the Second World War, the Gate won two Kent League championships under manager Charlie Walker, before moving to the Southern League in 1959-60. The club achieved success under manager Almer Hall and reached the third round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in 1935-36. In 1997-98 Margate reached the first round proper of the FA Cup, and in 2002-03 they defeated Leyton Orient to reach the second round. In 2000-01 Margate won the Southern League Premier Division championship and were promoted to the Football Conference. After a number of years of financial difficulty, Margate returned to Hartsdown Park in 2005 and achieved promotion to the National League South in 2015-16. In 2018, The Libertines became shirt sponsors for Margate and Steve Watt was appointed Manager. After a tough Christmas, Jay Saunders was appointed as Manager until the end of the season and guided Margate to a 12th place finish. Saunders was then appointed permanent Manager ahead of the 2019-20 season.",

The club has achieved a number of successes over the years, including winning the Premier Division and Division 1 titles of the North London Combination, the Herts Senior County League Premier Division title, the South Midlands Premier Division title, the Herts FA Charity Shield, the Potters Bar Charity Cup, and reaching the quarter final of the FA Vase. In 1998, the club secured a 21-year lease on its ground, Parkfield, and since then has undertaken major ground improvements, including the installation of floodlights, the construction of a 150 seater stand, and the erection of a perimeter fence. The club celebrated its 50th anniversary in May 2010, with many former players joining them, and the first team reverted to the same kit they wore in June 1960. The main stand was later renamed the 'Bert Wright Stand' in honour of one of the club's founders.",

    "description": "Belper Town's nickname, 'The Nailers', is derived from the town's history of nail making in the middle ages. The club was originally formed in 1883 but went out of existence three times due to lack of finance. In 1951, the club reformed and took up residence at Christchurch Meadow. They joined the Central Alliance League and won the Derbyshire Senior Cup in 1959. They were invited to join the Midland Counties League, but finished bottom three times. They won the championship in 1980/81 and then merged with the Yorkshire League to form the Northern Counties East League, which they won in 1984/85. They achieved success in the FA Vase and took their place in the Northern Premier League 12 years after they had first been invited. They have enjoyed a number of successes over the years, including winning the Derbyshire Senior Cup and reaching the play-off final twice. The club is currently managed by Grant Black and Mick Norbury.",

It enjoyed a productive period at the turn of the 20th century, winning four league titles, and returned to the Northern Premier League in 1981-82. In 2010, Hyde agreed a deal for Manchester City's elite development squad to use Ewen Fields. In 2011-12, Hyde won the championship and promotion to the national division. However, the club suffered back-to-back relegations and returned to the NPL. In 2016, the club secured funding from Tameside Council to lay a FIFA 2* 3G pitch, and in 2017, Hyde gained automatic promotion to the Evo-Stik Premier Division. The 2019/20 season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2020/21 season sees the ground returned to its traditional red.",

It joined the Birmingham League in 1900-01 and in 1926-27 won the league title and twice finished runners-up. During the 1930s, the team struggled to survive financially, and was disbanded during WWII. In 1979, they won the FA Trophy and in 1985, the North Staffordshire League title. Following spells in the Birmingham League and Southern Premier League, they returned to the Conference Premier in 2006 but were relegated back to Conference North after two seasons. They then dropped to the third tier of the pyramid, before being rescued from relegation in 2014. In 2016-17, they won the Evo-Stik First Division South title and in 2018 the Shed End of their stadium was opened. In 2020, the Northern Premier League declared the season null and void, saving Rangers from relegation. Matty Hill and Dale Belford are the current managers of the club.",

After playing in the Lancashire & Cheshire Amateur League, they turned professional and joined the Lancashire Combination as second division champions. They then joined the Southern League, but were denied a place in the Football League due to local bureaucracy and instead joined the Central League. They were one of the founder members of the Third Division (North) in 1921, but were unable to maintain their presence in the league and had to resign, eventually joining the Cheshire County League in the aftermath of World War II. After making a lot of progress in the league, in 1980 they won the Bass NW Championship, then again in 1984 and 1987, before joining the Conference in 1992. They were relegated back to the NPL in 1998, but made a resurgence in 1999, winning the League Cup and the Cheshire Senior Cup in 2001. After a few tough years, Phil Wilson returned and won the NPL in 2001, and then were promoted back to the Conference North in 2004. After a few years of struggle, they were relegated back to the NPL in 2014, and have remained there since, though they narrowly avoided relegation in 2020.",
